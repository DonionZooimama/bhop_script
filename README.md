# CS:GO bhop script

## how to run

### Run the command:
<pre><code>pip install requirments.txt
</code></pre>

You will then need to go into csgo and rebind some keys.
The way this script works is by using the space bar as a toggle and using the 'p' button to jump.
i.e. holding space will trigger auto hop and the script will then hit 'p' continuously making you jump.

In csgo terminal run the following:
<pre><code>unbind space
bind p +jump
</code></pre>

### Run the script:
<pre><code>python upup.py
</code></pre>

#### Hold space and you will autohop

The script will automatically disable when using 'y' or 'u' to communicate in chat. It will enable once you hit enter.
This is just so when you hit 'u' or 'y' to type in all chat you dont spam p's every time you hit the space bar.
You can also use enter to toggle the script on and off if you dont want to use it at a certain point.

 ## Note this will not get you VAC banned but could get you overwatch banned so use at your own risk.
