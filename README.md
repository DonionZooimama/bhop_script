# CS:GO bhop ppscript

## how to run

Run the command:
<pre><code>pip install requirments.txt
</code></pre>

Run the script:
<pre><code>python upup.py
</code></pre>

You will then need to go into csgo and rebind some keys.
The way this script works is by using the space bar as a toggle and using the 'p' button to jump.
i.e. hold space and trigger auto hop. script will then hit 'p' continuously.

In csgo terminal run the following:
<pre><code>unbind space
bind p +jumo
</code></pre>

Now if you have the scrpit running in the backgorund and you hit space you will auto hop.

You can also disable and enable the script by hitting either 't' or enter i.e. '\n'
this is just so when you hit 't' to typ in all chat you dont spam p's every time you
hit space and once youre done you will hit enter and enable the script again.

 ## Note this will not get you VAC banned but could get you overwatch banned so use at your own risk.
